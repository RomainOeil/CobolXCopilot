# Test Plan for Python Application

This test plan has the objective to test the program in its ability to reproduce the behaviour of the original Cobol Application. The goal of the project is to convert the Cobol code into Python, and, to ensure complete compatibility with potential others solutions, the behaviour of the Python program replicate the behaviour of the Cobol program.

| TC-2.1       | Credit Account with Valid Amount               | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 2 to credit the account. <br> 3. Enter a valid credit amount (e.g., 100.00). | The application should display the new balance after adding the credit amount. |                |                    |          |
| TC-2.2       | Credit Account with Zero Amount                | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 2 to credit the account. <br> 3. Enter 0.00 as the credit amount. | The application should display the same balance as before.                     |                |                    |          |
| TC-2.3       | Credit Account with Negative Amount            | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 2 to credit the account. <br> 3. Enter a negative credit amount (e.g., -100.00). | The application should display the new balance after adding the absolute value of the credit amount. |                |                    |          |
| TC-2.4       | Credit Account with Invalid Amount             | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 2 to credit the account. <br> 3. Enter an invalid amout (e.g., abc). | The application should display the same balance as before. |                |                    |          |
| TC-3.1       | Debit Account with Valid Amount                | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 3 to debit the account. <br> 3. Enter a valid debit amount that is less than or equal to the current balance (e.g., 50.00). | The application should display the new balance after subtracting the debit amount. |                |                    |          |
| TC-3.2       | Debit Account with Negative Amount             | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 3 to debit the account. <br> 3. Enter a negative debit amount that is less than or equal to the current balance if absolute (e.g., -50.00). | The application should display the new balance after subtracting the absolute value of the debit amount. |                |                    |          |
| TC-3.3       | Debit Account with Amount Greater Than Balance | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 3 to debit the account. <br> 3. Enter a debit amount that is greater than the current balance (e.g., 2000.00). | The application should display an "Insufficient funds" message and the balance should remain unchanged. |                |                    |          |
| TC-3.4       | Debit Account with Zero Amount                 | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 3 to debit the account. <br> 3. Enter 0.00 as the debit amount. | The application should display the same balance as before.                     |                |                    |          |
| TC-3.5       | Debit Account with Invalid Amount              | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 3 to debit the account. <br> 3. Enter an invalid amout (e.g., abc). | The application should display the same balance as before.                     |                |                    |          |
| TC-4.1       | Exit the Application                           | Application started  | 1. Start the application. <br> 2. Select option 4 to exit the application. | The application should display an exit message and terminate.                  |                |                    |          |

## Summary

This test plan covers the main functionalities of the COBOL application, including viewing the balance, crediting the account, debiting the account, and exiting the application. Validate this test plan with the business stakeholders to ensure it meets the business requirements. Once validated, you can use this plan to create corresponding unit tests and integration tests for the Python application.
